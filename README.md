# Bike Usage Analysis

## Overview

This analysis is made with the purpose of evaluating the viability of a bikesharing project in Des Moines based on the public info for New York City. For ease of usage, screenshots of our study are attached but should you wish to check out our study you can in the following link: [to Tableau dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel.alvarez2413/viz/BikeSharing_16575078629800/BikesharingStory).

## Results

First, we analyzed that on average users use bikes for about 15 minutes. This could be due to the ease of movement in NYC.

As an added point to this, we observe that most of our users are male.

We now analyzed tha the time where the bikes are mostly used are during the morning hours and in the sundown time. This is mere speculation but it could be that people in NYC prefer transporting to their offices in bikes instead of cars or public transportation.

The next keeps making it obvious that most of clients are male.

Again, most of our subscribers are male.

This is a more visual conclusion that most of our trips are used during the morning and the afternoon. This leaves the impression that we should prepare to satisfy demand in these particular hours.

Finally, in the NYC data we can conclude that most of the starting points are around office building or tourist attractions. This gives us a potential year-round market and not only focused of holiday times.

## Summary

This is a viable start point for business, maybe an anlysis of age usage could be useful for future reference as to be certain that workers and vacationers are the real target market. Our starting and end points should be put around office areas and tourist attractions.
